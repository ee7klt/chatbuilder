Chat.guide(2)
Experiment with the  Chat.fetch()  helper
* This function downloads the most recent messages from the server and makes them available to you.
* Note that it is asyncronous in nature, so it doesn't return anything. Instead, it accepts a function as its only argument.  (When a function is passed as an argument, we call it a 'callback'.)
* When  .fetch()  is done fetching messages from the server, it will call your callback function, passing an array of strings as the only argument to the callback. Each string in that array is the text value of one chat message.
