    <!--
Nice, you found the elements panel! From here, you can inspect the current state of the DOM tree, which is what controls everything your users see on the screen. At first, this DOM tree is built from the code in the original `.html` file, but it can be updated and changed at any time with JavaScript.

To see what I mean, click ->HERE<- and then press escape a few times slowly. The console window should open and close. Try typing this line of code into that console:

jQuery('body').prepend( Chat.guide.now_keep_your_eyes_on_the_elements_panel );
-->

    <h2>Borken Chat</h2>

    <input class="draft" type="text"> <button class="send" disabled="">Send</button>

    <ul class="messages">
      <!-- once you save this code to a local `.html` file, you can delete these 3 fake, hard-coded li elements -->
  
    </ul>
